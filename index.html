        <p><strong>Full Background:</strong></p>

        <p>Crew Berggren was born 1997, graduated high-school and attended a community college in Coos Bay Oregon, USA.
            Taking Spanish in high-school he incidentally found it exceedingly easy to learn the language. He was
            therefore motivated and, the summer after graduation, he decided to learn Portuguese. He felt comfortable
            speaking, reading and understanding Portuguese before he started the fall semester at the community college
            that year. There he focused on core sciences, taking biology, chemistry, microbiology, anatomy and
            physiology, physics, and calculus, following a love for math and science which had also led him to volunteer
            at the local hospital. After Portuguese he learned German over the course of a year, and to improve and
            solidify his ability, he went to visit the German-speaking parts of Europe for two months. For some years
            Crew taught English to Spanish and Portuguese speakers, often ones who knew absolutely no English, giving a
            pleasant confidence and dexterity in both languages. Thereafter he wished to treat himself to another "easy"
            language and so learned Italian over the course of half a year. All the time loving biology and literature
            more than language, however, he spent far more time reading either biology and chemistry textbooks or
            classic English, French and Russian novels. Inspired by the Russian novels, he struggled much more painfully
            in effort to learn Russian with which he still now wrestles. To relieve himself of the arduous task of
            learning Russian he played a video game in French for two months and was thereafter convinced that his
            comprehension, vocabulary and accent in French was at least satisfactory, though grammatically weak.</p>

        <p>Living situations which fortified his confidence in various languages or speaking skills:</p>

        <p>1) Crew lived in Germany for two and a half years.</p>
        <p>2) Married to a lovely German woman for 4 years.</p>
        <p>3) Lived in Northern Italy for four months where his parents own a house.</p>
        <p>4) Two month vacation in Portugal and two years teaching English to Brazilians.</p>
        <p>5) Assistance with Russian speaking Ukrainian refugees in Germany, including translation assistance with
            refugee paperwork and appointments.</p>
        <p>6) Lived in the Dominican Republic for two months and altogether spent endless hours with Mexicans.</p>
        <p>7) Every week for his entire life he has also attended a church meeting at which one observes or gives
            public speeches, presentations, and demonstrations after which one is given constructive criticism based on
            set a criterium of a particular textbook. For most of his life this was in English, for two and a half years
            it was in Spanish, and for two other years it was in German.
